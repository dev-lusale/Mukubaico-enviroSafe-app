Mukubaico Enviro-Safe Monitoring System
Project Overview

Mukubaico Enviro-Safe is an innovative mobile and web-based application designed to enhance environmental safety in mining operations. The system monitors tailings storage facilities (TSFs) in real-time, helping prevent environmental hazards such as contamination, flooding, or structural failures. By leveraging IoT sensors, data analytics, and automated alerts, Mukubaico provides mining operators with actionable insights to maintain compliance and ensure operational safety.

Features

Real-Time Monitoring: Collects live data from sensors installed at tailings storage facilities.

Alerts & Notifications: Sends immediate warnings for threshold breaches (e.g., high water levels, toxic gas detection).

Data Visualization: Interactive dashboards displaying key environmental metrics and historical trends.

Predictive Analysis: Uses collected data to predict potential hazards and suggest preventive actions.

Secure Access: Role-based access for mining operators, safety managers, and administrators.

Mobile & Web Support: Access the system via both web and mobile platforms for on-site and remote monitoring.

Problem Statement

Large-scale mining operations often face challenges such as:

Irregular inspections and outdated monitoring systems.

Budget constraints leading to reactive rather than proactive safety measures.

High risk of environmental contamination due to TSF failures.

Difficulty complying with safety and regulatory standards efficiently.

Mukubaico addresses these issues by providing an affordable, scalable, and user-friendly monitoring solution.
