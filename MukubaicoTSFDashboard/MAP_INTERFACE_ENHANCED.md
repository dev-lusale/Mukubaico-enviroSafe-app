## 📊 SPACE ALLOCATION COMPARISON

### Before Enhancement:
```
Header Section:        Auto height
Server Status:         Auto height  
3D Model Display:      200px (LARGE)
Interactive Map:       * (remaining space)
Control Buttons:       Auto height
Active Layers:         Auto height
```

### After Enhancement:
```
Header Section:        Auto height
Server Status:         Auto height
Compact 3D Info:       Auto height (SMALL)
Large Interactive Map: 500px minimum (MAXIMIZED)
Control Buttons:       Auto height
Active Layers:         Auto height
```

**Result**: Map area increased by approximately 150-200px, providing significantly more space for map visibility.
